*End Goal:*
- User can create a poll of possible times for a meeting and send the link via email to the possible attendees (listing which people are required).
- Attendees can select which times are suitable, enter their email address and calendar they use (gcal, outlook, ical, etc.).
- If all required attendees choose a time, app chooses time that the requirees can make with the most votes by everyone invited as meeting time.
- App sends calendar invite out to everyone in format of each attendee's calendar.
